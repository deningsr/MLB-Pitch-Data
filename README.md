# MLB Pitch Data

#### MLB Pitch Data is my capstone project for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Program. Its purpose is to display what I have learned during the course and showcase my skills. I have chosen to focus on using big data for this project by utilizing technologies such Spark, PostgresSQL, and Airflow to create a working ETL pipeline.

# Purpose

#### This project is intended to provide sports analysts, scouts, and baseball enthusiasts with a wealth of pitch-level data for MLB games between 2015-2018. The data can support these parties with trends on pitches, batters, and pitch types and can help answer a variety of questions.

# Data Sources

#### The source data is taken from the MLB Pitch Data 2015-2018 found on Kaggle.com. Several individual datasets are pulled from this source and are detailed below:

* MLB Pitch Data: Contains pitch-level data such as pitcher, batter, pitch type, speed of pitch, and result of the pitch (strike, ball, out, etc..)

* MLB at-bat Data: Contains at-bat-level data such as pitcher, batter, at-bat result, and current inning.

* MLB Games Data: Contains game-level data such as home team, away team, date, and final score.

* MLB Player Names Data: Contains first and last names of pitchers and batters. Used as a helper dataset to join player names.
